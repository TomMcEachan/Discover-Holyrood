# Discover Holyrood - BSc Software Development Honours Project

The code for my BSc Honours Software Development (GA) project - Discover Holyrood. It includes code for a Next.js 13 front-end, a Strapi CMS, and a Meilisearch index. It also includes various unit, end-to-end, and component tests. 

Discover Holyrood was a prototype web-based augmented reality project that aimed to help young people and tourist learn about the work of the Scottish Parliament. 

I employed a user first development approach throughout the engineering process, successfully proving that an application of this type could be useful to a legislative body such as the Scottish Parliament. 

Overall, this project was well recieved both by the organisation and by the unversity, with the project recieving a 90% (Upper First Class) mark overall. This contributed to me winning the coveted University Medal upon my graduation from University, alongside my First Class award.
